# Hypothesis Test for the Mean of a Single Sample

This procedure evaluates whether the **population mean ($\mu$)** matches a hypothesized value using sample statistics.

---

## Types of One-Sample Mean Tests

Two types of tests exist depending on knowledge of population parameters:

1. **Known $\sigma$**:  
   The sample comes from a normal distribution and the **population standard deviation** is known. Use a **Z-test**.

2. **Unknown $\sigma$ (most common case)**:  
   The sample comes from a normal distribution and $\sigma$ is **estimated by sample standard deviation ($s$)**. Use a **Student’s $t$-test**.

In most real-world scenarios, $\sigma$ is unknown—so we proceed using the *t*-test method.

## Hypotheses

Example setup for a two-sided test:

$$
H_0: \mu = 40\ \text{kg} \quad \text{(null hypothesis)} \\
H_1: \mu \neq 40\ \text{kg} \quad \text{(alternative hypothesis)}
$$

---

## Test Statistic Formula

For a single-sample $t$-test:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}}
$$

Where:
- $\bar{x}$ = sample mean  
- $\mu_0$ = hypothesized population mean  
- $s$ = sample standard deviation  
- $n$ = sample size  
- Degrees of freedom: $$df = n - 1$$

---

## Worked Example

A sample of 25 Irish students has:
- Sample mean: $\bar{x} = 174\ \text{cm}$  
- Sample variance: $100\ \text{cm}^2$ → so $s = \sqrt{100} = 10$  
- Hypothesized mean: $\mu_0 = 170$  
- Significance level: $\alpha = 0.05$

### Apply Formula:

$$
t = \frac{174 - 170}{10 / \sqrt{25}} = \frac{4}{2} = 2.00
$$

Compare this $t$ value to the critical value for $df = 24$ at $\alpha/2 = 0.025$ (for a two-tailed test).

---

## Two-Sided Test Logic

Used when deviations in **either direction** from $\mu_0$ are of concern.

- Reference point: hypothesized mean ($\mu_0$)
- Decision: if $$|t| > t_{df,\alpha/2}$$ → **Reject $H_0$**

---

## Final Summary

### When testing a population mean:
- Use a **$t$-test** if $\sigma$ is unknown (most common scenario)
- State $H_0$ and $H_1$
- Compute the **test statistic** using sample mean and sample SD
- Evaluate against critical values or use **p-value**

### Notes:
- Strong conclusions require **small p-values** and appropriate sample sizes
- Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals share the same structure:
  - Same standard errors
  - Same quantiles from $Z$ or $t$ distributions

### For Proportions:
- Hypothesis tests for sample proportions follow similar steps  
- Standard error is based on expected value under $H_0$ (not sample estimate)
