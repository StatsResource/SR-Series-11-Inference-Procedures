## Computing Confidence Intervals

A **confidence interval** provides an estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter. The general form is:

\[
\text{Point Estimate} \pm (\text{Quantile} \times \text{Standard Error})
\]

Where:

- **Point Estimate**: Sample statistic (e.g., mean or proportion)
- **Quantile**: A value from a probability distribution corresponding to the confidence level
- **Standard Error**: Measures variability of the sample estimate across samples of size \( n \)

---

## Confidence Intervals (Revision)

- A **95% confidence interval** contains the true population value in 95 out of 100 repeated samples.
- There's a **5% chance** that the interval does **not** capture the population parameter.
- Other typical confidence levels include **90%**, **99%**, and **99.9%**.

---

## Confidence Level (Revision)

- A confidence level is denoted by \( 1 - \alpha \)
- Example: A 95% confidence level corresponds to \( \alpha = 0.05 \)
- Calculation:
  \[
  100(1 - \alpha)\% = 100(1 - 0.05)\% = 95\%
  \]
- Correct specification of \( \alpha \) is critical when determining quantiles.

---

## Quantiles

- A **quantile** determines the "cut-off" value from a distribution for a given confidence level.
- For large samples (typically \( n > 30 \)), the **standard normal distribution** is used.
- Quantiles satisfy:
  \[
  P(-a \leq Z \leq a) = 1 - \alpha
  \]

### Common Z-Quantiles

| Confidence Level | Quantile (\( z_{\alpha/2} \)) |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| 90%              | 1.645                         |
| 95%              | 1.96                          |
| 99%              | 2.576                         |

## Types of Confidence Intervals for Sample Means

### Type 1: Known Population Variance

- Used primarily for teaching; rare in practice.
- Formula:
  \[
  \bar{x} \pm z_{(\alpha/2)} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
  \]
- Quantiles come from Z-tables.

### Type 2: Large Sample, Unknown Population Variance

- Applies when \( n > 30 \)
- Estimate population SD using sample SD \( s \)
- Use same formula structure but replace \( \sigma \) with \( s \):
  \[
  \text{S.E.}(\bar{x}) = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
  \]

### Type 3: Small Sample, Unknown Population Variance

- Applies when \( n \leq 30 \)
- Use **Student's t-distribution**
- Degrees of freedom: \( df = n - 1 \)
- Confidence interval quantiles are from t-tables

---

## Using the t-Distribution for All Sample Sizes

- For **small samples**, use \( df = n - 1 \)
- For **large samples**, t-distribution converges to the Z-distribution
- You can use the t-distribution even for large samples by setting:
  \[
  df = \infty
  \]

This approach makes the t-distribution a flexible tool for computing confidence intervals across a range of sample sizes.
