## Question 10: Two-Sample Z-Test (Known Variances)

A survey was conducted to determine whether women study more hours than men at a particular college.

- Sample of women:  
  \( n_1 = 10, \ \bar{x}_1 = 120, \ \sigma_1 = 28 \)
  
- Sample of men:  
  \( n_2 = 12, \ \bar{x}_2 = 105, \ \sigma_2 = 35 \)

**Hypotheses:**

- \( H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 \)  
- \( H_a: \mu_1 > \mu_2 \) (one-tailed test)

**R Code:**

```r
xbar1 <- 120
xbar2 <- 105
sd1 <- 28
sd2 <- 35
n1 <- 10
n2 <- 12

TS <- ((xbar1 - xbar2) - 0) / sqrt((sd1^2 / n1) + (sd2^2 / n2))
TS  # [1] 1.116536
```

**Critical value (for one-tailed test at 5% significance):**

```r
qnorm(0.95)  # [1] 1.644854
```

Since **1.1165 < 1.6449**, we fail to reject \( H_0 \). There is not enough evidence to conclude that women study more than men.

**p-value:**

```r
1 - pnorm(1.116536)  # or use pnorm(1.116536, lower.tail = FALSE)
# [1] 0.1320964
```

Since the p-value > 0.05, the result is not statistically significant.

## Question 8: Two-Proportion Z-Test

A gardening show survey examined the link between **purchase behavior** and **intention to return next year**.

- Total respondents: 220
- Purchased: 101 → 69 intend to return  
- Not purchased: 119 → 68 intend to return

**Hypotheses:**

- \( H_0 \): Return rates are equal for both groups  
- \( H_1 \): Return rates are not equal

**Proportions:**

- Purchasers: \( p_1 = 69 / 101 \approx 0.683 \)
- Non-purchasers: \( p_2 = 68 / 119 \approx 0.571 \)

**Difference in proportions:**

\[
D = p_1 - p_2 = 0.1117
\]

**Estimated Standard Error of D:**  
\[
SE(D) \approx 0.06558
\]

**Test Statistic:**

\[
Z = \frac{0.1117}{0.06558} \approx 1.704
\]

Since **1.704 < 1.96**, we **fail to reject** \( H_0 \). There is insufficient evidence to claim an association between purchase and intention to return.
