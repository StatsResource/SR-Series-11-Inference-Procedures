Central Limit Theorem
=============================

## Sampling Distribution

- A **sampling distribution** is a probability distribution of a statistic (e.g. mean, median, variance) obtained from a large number of samples drawn from the same population.
- It represents the distribution of values a statistic can take due to random sampling.

## The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

The central limit theorem allows statisticians to use sample statistics to make inferences about population parameters without requiring the population distribution to be normal.

Key insights:

- Many statistics (e.g. sample mean, sample variance) tend toward a **normal distribution**, even if the underlying population is not normally distributed.
- Even with non-normal populations, the distribution of sample statistics becomes approximately normal when the **sample size is large** (typically \( n > 30 \)).

## Simulation Example (R)

A large population is generated using a combination of random normal samples with different means and standard deviations:

```r
Z <- c(
  rnorm(300, 10, 3),
  rnorm(150, 15, 1),
  rnorm(100, 24, 3.5),
  rnorm(200, 30, 4),
  rnorm(400, 45, 6),
  rnorm(500, 60, 2)
)
Population <- Z
hist(Population, breaks = -1:69, col = c("midnightblue", "lightblue", "slateblue"))
```

100 samples of size 60 are taken from the population. For each sample, the mean, median, and variance are computed and their Q-Q plots are evaluated for normality:

```r
Mean.Sample <- Median.Sample <- Var.Sample <- numeric()

for (i in 1:100) {
  Sample <- sample(Z, 60)
  Mean.Sample <- c(Mean.Sample, mean(Sample))
  Median.Sample <- c(Median.Sample, median(Sample))
  Var.Sample <- c(Var.Sample, var(Sample))
}

qqnorm(Mean.Sample, pch = 18, col = "red"); qqline(Mean.Sample)
qqnorm(Median.Sample, pch = 18, col = "red"); qqline(Median.Sample)
qqnorm(Var.Sample, pch = 18, col = "red"); qqline(Var.Sample)
```

These plots reveal that even when the population is not normal, the **sampling distributions** of these statistics appear approximately normal.

## Theoretical Summary of CLT

Suppose \( X \sim \text{Any Distribution} \), with:

- Mean: \( \mu = E(X) \)
- Variance: \( \sigma^2 \)

Then, for samples of size \( n \):

- The **sampling distribution** of \( \bar{X} \) tends to be normal when \( n \) is large
- \( \text{Mean of } \bar{X} = \mu \)
- \( \text{Standard Deviation of } \bar{X} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \), also called the **standard error (SE)**

## Quantile Functions and R Syntax

### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

Given a threshold \( k \), compute probability:

\[
P(X \leq k)
\]

- In R: `pnorm(k)`

### Quantile Function (Inverse CDF)

Given a probability \( p \), find threshold \( k \) such that:

\[
P(X \leq k) = p
\]

- In R: `qnorm(p)`

Examples:

```r
qnorm(0.975)    # returns ~1.96
qnorm(0.8997)   # returns ~1.28
```
