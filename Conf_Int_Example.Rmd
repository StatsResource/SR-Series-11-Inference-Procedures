Here's a polished markdown tutorial based on your LaTeX document that walks through the process of constructing a confidence interval for the difference between two means.

# Confidence Intervals: Difference Between Two Means

This tutorial outlines how to compute a confidence interval for the difference between two population means when certain statistical assumptions are satisfied.

---

## Assumptions

To construct a valid confidence interval for \( \mu_X - \mu_Y \), we assume:

- **Homogeneity of variance**: The two populations have equal variances.
- **Normality**: Each population is normally distributed.
- **Independence**: Each sample is independently drawn from its population.

---

## Formula: Standard Error of the Difference

Given two independent samples with means \( \bar{X}, \bar{Y} \), variances \( s_X^2, s_Y^2 \), and sizes \( n_X, n_Y \), the standard error of the difference is:

\[
SE(\bar{X} - \bar{Y}) = \sqrt{ \frac{s_X^2}{n_X} + \frac{s_Y^2}{n_Y} }
\]

- \( s_X^2, s_Y^2 \): sample variances  
- \( n_X, n_Y \): sample sizes  
- Degrees of freedom: \( n_X + n_Y - 2 \)

---

## Example

| Group | Sample Size | Mean   | Variance |
|-------|-------------|--------|----------|
| X     | 17          | 5.353  | 2.743    |
| Y     | 17          | 3.882  | 2.985    |

### Step 1: Point Estimate

\[
\bar{X} - \bar{Y} = 5.353 - 3.882 = 1.4699
\]

### Step 2: Standard Error (Given)

\[
SE = 0.5805
\]

### Step 3: Quantile (95% Confidence)

\[
z = 1.96
\]

### Step 4: Confidence Interval

\[
CI = 1.4699 \pm (1.96 \times 0.5805) = (0.33212, 2.60768)
\]

---

## Interpretation

There is evidence that the mean for group X exceeds that of group Y. With 95% confidence, the population mean difference lies between approximately **0.33 and 2.61**.
