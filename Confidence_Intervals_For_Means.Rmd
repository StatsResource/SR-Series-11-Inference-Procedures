## Confidence Intervals for Means

The general structure of a confidence interval for the population mean is:

\[
\bar{x} \pm (\text{Quantile} \times \text{Standard Error})
\]

### Quantiles (Z-values for large samples \( n > 30 \))

| Confidence Level | Quantile (Z) |
|------------------|--------------|
| 90%              | 1.645        |
| 95%              | 1.960        |
| 99%              | 2.576        |

### Sample Mean

The sample mean \( \bar{x} \) is usually provided in the question. It is considered a **point estimate** for the true population mean.

---

### Standard Error

Standard error is computed using the sample standard deviation \( s \) and sample size \( n \):

\[
SE(\bar{x}) = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
\]

---

### Interpretation of Confidence Intervals

- A **95% confidence interval** has a 95% probability of containing the true population parameter.
- This implies a 5% chance the interval does **not** include the true value.
- Confidence levels such as **90%**, **95%**, **99%**, and **99.9%** are commonly used.

---

### Relationship Between Confidence Level and α

- Confidence level is expressed as \( 100(1 - \alpha)\% \)
- For 95% confidence: \( \alpha = 0.05 \)
- For 99% confidence: \( \alpha = 0.01 \)
- Knowing \( \alpha \) is essential for determining quantile values.

## Confidence Intervals for the Difference of Two Means

If \( \bar{X} \) and \( \bar{Y} \) are sample means from two independent populations:

\[
(\bar{X} - \bar{Y}) \pm \left(\text{Quantile} \times SE(\bar{X} - \bar{Y})\right)
\]

- If the **combined sample size** exceeds 30, the large-sample Z-quantile is appropriate.

---

### Example: Known Parameters

Suppose:

- Drug group: \( \mu = 50, \ \sigma^2 = 25 \)
- Control group: \( \mu = 40, \ \sigma^2 = 24 \)

You can use these known parameters to construct a confidence interval.

---

## Standard Error Summary

- **Standard error** reflects variability of the sample statistic.
- Each point estimate (mean, proportion, etc.) has its own SE formula.
- For the mean:

\[
SE(\bar{x}) = 
\begin{cases}
\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} & \text{if population } \sigma \text{ known} \\
\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} & \text{if } \sigma \text{ is estimated}
\end{cases}
\]

---

## Confidence Interval for a Mean (Small Sample)

If the data are normally distributed and \( s \) is used to estimate \( \sigma \), the confidence interval becomes:

\[
\bar{X} \pm t_{1 - \alpha/2, n - 1} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
\]

Where \( t_{1 - \alpha/2, n - 1} \) is the quantile from the Student's t-distribution with \( n - 1 \) degrees of freedom.

---

## Introduction to Hypothesis Testing

- We've discussed **one-sample confidence intervals** for a mean and a proportion.
- Later, we’ll explore **two-sample confidence intervals**.
- Before that, we shift focus to **hypothesis testing**.

---

### Quantile Reminder

If sample size \( n > 30 \) and confidence level is 95%, the appropriate quantile is:

\[
z = 1.96
\]
