# Estimation in Statistics

Statistical estimation is the process of using data from a sample to make inferences about a broader population. There are two main types of estimation:

- **Point Estimation**
- **Interval Estimation**

---

## Point Estimates

A **point estimate** provides a single best guess of a population parameter, based on sample data. It is computed using a **statistic** from the sample.

### Examples

- The **sample mean** \( \bar{x} \) is the best point estimate of the **population mean** \( \mu \).
- The **sample proportion** \( \hat{p} \) is the best point estimate of the **population proportion** \( p \).

While point estimates are useful, they come with **error**â€”the actual population value may be higher or lower than the estimate.

---

## Interval Estimates

An **interval estimate**, or confidence interval, provides a **range of values** that is likely to contain the population parameter.

### Key Concepts

- Defined by **lower** and **upper confidence limits**
- Associated with a **confidence level** (e.g. 90%, 95%, or 99%)
- Wider intervals offer more certainty that the true value lies within

---

## Confidence Intervals

A confidence interval is computed using:

\[
\text{Statistic} \pm (\text{Quantile} \times \text{Standard Error})
\]

Where the **statistic** might be a sample mean or proportion, and the **quantile** depends on the desired confidence level:

### Quantile Selection

- Use the **Z-distribution** if standard deviation is **known**  
  \[
  \bar{x} \pm Z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \text{SE}
  \]
- Use the **t-distribution** if standard deviation is **unknown**, with \( n-1 \) degrees of freedom  
  \[
  \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2, \, n-1} \cdot \text{SE}
  \]

### Common Quantile Values

| Confidence Level | Z/T Value (Approximate) |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| 90%              | 1.645                    |
| 95%              | 1.96                     |
| 99%              | 2.58                     |

---

## Margin of Error

The **margin of error (E)** represents half the width of the confidence interval:

\[
E = \frac{\text{Upper Limit} - \text{Lower Limit}}{2}
\]

---

## Pooled Proportion Estimate

When comparing two sample proportions, the **pooled estimate** \( \bar{p} \) combines the success counts:

\[
\bar{p} = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{n_1 + n_2}
\]

---

## Matched Pairs vs. Independent Samples

### Matched Pairs

- Each observation in one sample is paired with one in the other (e.g. before-and-after measurements)
- Data should be randomly sampled

### Independent Samples

- Samples drawn separately from two populations
- No link between observations
- Samples may have different sizes and variances

If the populations are normally distributed, comparisons are typically made between:
- Means: \( \bar{x}, \bar{y} \)
- Variances: \( s_x^2, s_y^2 \)

---

## Standard Error of the Sample Mean

\[
\text{SE}(\bar{x}) = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
\]

Where:
- \( \sigma \): population standard deviation
- \( n \): sample size

This formula is key when calculating confidence intervals or hypothesis tests involving the sample mean.
