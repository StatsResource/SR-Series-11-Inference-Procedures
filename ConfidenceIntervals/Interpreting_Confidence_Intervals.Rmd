# Interpreting Confidence Intervals

### Key Ideas:
- Confidence intervals are two bounds that define a plausible range for a population parameter.
- When comparing two group means, the confidence interval for the difference helps assess whether one group is significantly higher than the other.

### Example Scenario:
- Suppose \( \bar{x}_B - \bar{x}_A = 30 \) (i.e., Group B scores 30 points higher on average).
- A 95% confidence interval is given as \( (-15, 75) \).

#### Interpretation:
- **Upper bound (+75)**: Group B could be up to 75 points higher than Group A.
- **Lower bound (−15)**: Group A could be up to 15 points higher than Group B.
- **Zero is within the interval**: So it’s possible both groups have equal means.
- Conclusion: We cannot be 95% confident that Group B scores higher than Group A.

# Confidence Interval Basics

### Point Estimation and Accuracy
- The sample mean \( \bar{x} \) is an **unbiased estimator** of the population mean \( \mu \).
- However, the probability that \( \bar{x} \) exactly equals \( \mu \) is mathematically zero.
- To express **uncertainty**, we use a confidence interval around \( \bar{x} \).

### Confidence Interval Definition
A confidence interval provides a range where the true population parameter is expected to fall with a specified level of confidence (e.g., 95%).

- The confidence level (e.g., 95%) means that if we repeated the sampling many times, **95% of the constructed intervals** would contain the true mean.

## Formula Structure

\[
\text{Confidence Interval} = \bar{x} \pm Z \cdot SE
\]

- \( \bar{x} \): sample mean  
- \( Z \): quantile from the normal or t-distribution  
- \( SE \): standard error  
- The term \( \pm Z \cdot SE \) is often referred to as the **margin of error**

---

# Distribution Guidelines

- Use **normal distribution** for large samples (\( n > 30 \))
- Use **t-distribution** if:
  - Sample is small (\( n \leq 30 \))
  - Population is normally distributed
  - Population standard deviation \( \sigma \) is unknown

### Degrees of Freedom:
\[
df = n - 1
\]

## Battery Example: Calculating a CI

- Sample size: \( n = 100 \)
- Sample mean: \( \bar{x} = 57.4 \) hours
- Sample standard deviation: \( s = 15.1 \)
- Confidence level: 95%
- Since \( n = 100 \), use normal distribution → \( Z = 1.96 \)

### Calculation:
\[
SE = \frac{15.1}{\sqrt{100}} = 1.51
\]
\[
CI = 57.4 \pm (1.96 \cdot 1.51) = (54.44,\ 60.36)
\]
