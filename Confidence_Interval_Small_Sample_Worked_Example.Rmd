## Confidence Interval for a Mean (Small Sample)

- A random sample of \( n = 10 \) light bulbs has a **sample mean** of  
  \( \bar{x} = 4{,}000 \) hours and a **sample standard deviation**  
  \( s = 200 \) hours.

- The operating life of light bulbs is assumed to be approximately **normally distributed**.

- To estimate the **population mean** operating life, we construct a 95% confidence interval:

  \[
  4{,}000 \pm (2.262)(63.3) = (3{,}857,\ 4{,}143)
  \]

- The **standard error** is calculated as:

  \[
  SE(\bar{x}) = \frac{200}{\sqrt{10}} = 63.3
  \]

- For a 95% confidence level with \( df = 9 \), the **t-quantile** is 2.262.
