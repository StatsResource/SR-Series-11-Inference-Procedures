# Hypothesis Testing and Statistical Significance – A Practical Overview

## Independent Samples

Two samples are considered **independent** when the observations in one sample are not related to those in the other. This often occurs in:

- Randomized experiments with distinct groups (e.g. treatment A vs. treatment B)
- Surveys comparing two unrelated populations

We're often interested in the **difference between their means**, denoted \( \mu_1 - \mu_2 \).

### Conditions for Valid Inference

A confidence interval for the difference of means from two independent samples requires:

- Each sample is randomly selected
- Samples are independent
- Each population is at least 10 times larger than its respective sample
- The sampling distribution of the difference in means is approximately normal

---

## Standard Error Refresher

The **standard error (SE)** quantifies variability in a sampling distribution. It's used when estimating population parameters.

- For a sample mean when population standard deviation is **known**:
  
  \[
  SE(\bar{x}) = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
  \]

- In practice, population standard deviation is often **unknown**. So we estimate:

  \[
  SE(\bar{x}) = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
  \]

## Steps in Hypothesis Testing

1. **State the Hypotheses**  
   - Null hypothesis \( H_0 \)  
   - Alternative hypothesis \( H_1 \)

2. **Compute Test Statistic**  
   Use data and appropriate formulae (e.g., z or t scores)

3. **Determine Critical Value**  
   Based on:
   - Sample size → degrees of freedom
   - Significance level \( \alpha \)
   - One-tailed or two-tailed test

4. **Apply Decision Rule**  
   Compare the absolute value of the test statistic with the critical value

## Significance and Statistical Testing

**Statistical significance** determines whether the result of a study is likely due to chance.

- Denoted by the **significance level**, \( \alpha \)
- Typical values:  
  - \( \alpha = 0.05 \): 95% confidence  
  - \( \alpha = 0.01 \): 99% confidence (used in high-stakes fields like medicine)

### Key Concepts

- **Null value**: The expected value under the null hypothesis
- **Observed - Null**: Difference between data result and expected value
- If \( p \leq \alpha \), the result is **statistically significant**

---

## Example of Statistical Significance

Imagine testing whether baby girls smile more than baby boys.

- Null Hypothesis: No difference in average smiles
- Suppose \( t = 0.03 \), \( p < 0.05 \): the null hypothesis is rejected
- You conclude: **baby girls smile more**, with 95% confidence

Remember, **every experiment has variability**. Statistical significance helps rule out chance as the sole explanation.

---

## Significance Level Explained

- **"Significant" in statistics ≠ important in everyday language**
- A "highly significant" result means **strong evidence against the null**, not that the result is important
- Set \( \alpha \) based on context and consequences of error

\[
\text{Significance Level} = P(\text{Type I Error}) = \alpha
\]
