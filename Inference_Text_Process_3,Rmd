# Hypothesis Testing and Proportions – Summary Guide

## The Four Key Steps in Hypothesis Testing

1. **State the Hypotheses**
   - **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** Represents the status quo or no effect.
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** Represents a new claim or a difference.

2. **Compute the Test Statistic**
   - Use the appropriate formula (based on data and test type).
   - Check exam resources (e.g., formula tables) for guidance.

3. **Determine the Critical Value**
   - Depends on:
     - Sample size \( n \) → degrees of freedom = \( n - 1 \)
     - Number of tails \( k \): one-tailed or two-tailed test
     - Significance level \( \alpha \): commonly 0.05 or 0.01
   - Critical values come from distributions (Z or t).

4. **Apply the Decision Rule**
   - Compare \( | \text{test statistic} | \) with the critical value.
   - If it exceeds the critical value → reject \( H₀ \)

## Small Sample Case

- Use the **Student’s t-distribution** when:
  - Sample size \( n \leq 30 \)
  - Population standard deviation \( \sigma \) is **unknown**
- Degrees of freedom = \( n - 1 \)

---

## One-Tailed vs. Two-Tailed Tests

- **One-Tailed Test:** All critical values fall in one tail
  - Used when H₁ states a direction (e.g., “greater than” or “less than”)
  - Set \( k = 1 \) when using lookup tables

- **Two-Tailed Test:** Critical values fall in both tails
  - Used when H₁ is nondirectional (e.g., “not equal to”)
  - More commonly used in standard procedures

## Hypothesis Testing for Proportions

This lecture also covers hypothesis testing and confidence intervals for proportions, including:

- Confidence Interval for a Proportion
- One-Sample Test for a Proportion
- Two-Sample Test for Proportions
- Estimating an appropriate margin of error for proportions
