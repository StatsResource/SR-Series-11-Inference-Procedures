# Introduction to Inference

Statistical inference focuses on using data to support decision-making about populations. A **population** refers to a complete set of items or individuals relevant to a particular context.

### Examples of Populations

- A set of consumers or companies that make up a market
- Products coming off a manufacturing production line

### Types of Information for Decision-Making

- **Mean values**: e.g., average number of items purchased per person annually
- **Proportions**: e.g., percentage of faulty items produced

These metrics can drive decisions such as:

- Scaling up production capacity based on estimated demand
- Halting and adjusting production based on defect rates

### Why Use a Sample?

- It is typically impractical or impossible to study the entire population.
- Instead, data are collected from a **sample**, which is a subset of the population.
- Using this sample, we **infer** insights about the full population.
