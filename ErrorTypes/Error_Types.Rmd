# Hypothesis Testing: Understanding Type I and Type II Errors

## Introduction to Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is a formal procedure for evaluating two competing claims about a population. These claims are:

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** Assumes no effect or no difference  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** Suggests a significant effect or difference

The test helps us decide whether to reject H₀ based on sample evidence.

## Two Types of Error

When conducting a hypothesis test, there are two possible types of mistake:

| Decision               | H₀ True        | H₀ False         |
|------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Reject H₀             | Type I Error    | Correct Decision |
| Do Not Reject H₀      | Correct Decision| Type II Error    |

### Type I Error

- Rejecting H₀ when it is actually **true**
- Denoted by **α (alpha)**
- Often set by the researcher at 0.05 or 0.01
- Considered **more serious** because a true null hypothesis is wrongly rejected

### Type II Error

- Failing to reject H₀ when it is actually **false**
- Denoted by **β (beta)**
- Often arises due to:
  - **Small sample sizes**
  - **Low test sensitivity**
- It reflects a **missed opportunity** to detect a real effect

## Significance Level and Error Trade-off

- Reducing **α** (minimizing Type I errors) increases the chance of **β** (Type II errors), and vice versa
- This creates a **trade-off**:
  - Lowering α requires stronger evidence to reject H₀
  - But this increases the risk of failing to reject a false H₀

## Practical Illustration: Drug Test Example

Suppose you're testing whether two drugs are different in effectiveness.

- **Type I Error:** Conclude that there's a difference when, in fact, the drugs are equally effective
- **Type II Error:** Fail to detect a real difference between the two drugs when it does exist

## Die Toss Example

Imagine testing whether a die is fair:

- First die produces a sum of **401**:  
  Conclude it's crooked.  
  If it's actually fair → **Type I error**

- Second die produces a sum of **360**:  
  Conclude it's fair.  
  If it's actually biased → **Type II error**

## Summary

- **Type I Error (α):** False positive — rejecting a true null hypothesis  
- **Type II Error (β):** False negative — failing to reject a false null hypothesis  
- Managing these errors is key to robust experimental design
