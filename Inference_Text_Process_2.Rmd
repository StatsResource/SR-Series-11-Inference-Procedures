Here’s a polished markdown-based tutorial derived from your slides, blending confidence intervals, p-values, and critical values into one accessible guide for learners.

# Confidence Intervals, p-values, and Critical Values

---

## 1. Confidence Interval for a Mean (Small Sample)

Suppose a sample of 10 light bulbs yields:

- Sample mean: \( \bar{x} = 4000 \) hours  
- Sample standard deviation: \( s = 200 \) hours  
- Sample size: \( n = 10 \)

Assuming a normal distribution, the **standard error** is:

\[
\text{SE}(\bar{x}) = \frac{200}{\sqrt{10}} = 63.3
\]

Using a 95% confidence level and \( df = 9 \), the t-quantile is 2.262 (from Murdoch Barnes Table).

\[
\text{CI} = 4000 \pm (2.262)(63.3) = (3857, 4143)
\]

## 2. Interpreting Confidence Intervals

A confidence interval reflects uncertainty and allows inference about population parameters. Consider two student groups:

- Difference in sample means: \( \bar{x}_B - \bar{x}_A = 30 \)
- 95% CI: \( (-15, 75) \)

### Interpretation:

- Group B may have up to 75 more points than A.
- However, Group A may also score up to 15 more than B.
- Since 0 lies within the interval, we **cannot conclude** a significant difference with 95% confidence.

---

## 3. Types of Confidence Intervals

- **One-sample intervals:** For means or proportions from a single group.
- **Two-sample intervals:** Compare means or proportions between two independent groups.

---

## 4. Understanding p-values

- The **p-value** is the probability of obtaining a result as extreme as (or more extreme than) the observed one, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
- If the p-value is **less than the significance level \( \alpha \)** (e.g., 0.05), reject \( H_0 \).

### Example:

- \( p = 0.042 \): Reject \( H_0 \) at the 0.05 level
- \( p = 0.0001 \): Also leads to rejection at 0.05, but with stronger evidence

There’s a debate:
- **Traditional view:** p-values only determine whether to reject or not, based on \( \alpha \)
- **Modern view:** Smaller p-values offer **stronger evidence** against \( H_0 \)

---

## 5. Interpreting p-values Thoughtfully

- A **very small** p-value suggests stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.
- **Reporting exact p-values** allows readers to judge strength of evidence themselves.
- Example: \( p = 0.0001 \) is more compelling than \( p = 0.049 \), even though both cross the 0.05 threshold.

---

## 6. Critical Values

A **critical value** defines the cutoff that separates:

- The **rejection region** (where we reject \( H_0 \))
- The **acceptance region** (where we do not reject \( H_0 \))

It depends on:

- The test type (one-tailed or two-tailed)
- The significance level \( \alpha \)
- The distribution in use (Z, t, etc.)
