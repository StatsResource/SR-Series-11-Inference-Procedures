# Introduction to Hypothesis Testing

## What Is Hypothesis Testing?

- A statistical method used to make decisions based on data.
- A result is called **statistically significant** if it is unlikely to occur by chance.
- Comparable to a legal trial:
  - Presume innocence ($H_0$) until proven guilty ($H_1$).
  - Evidence must justify rejecting $H_0$ in favor of $H_1$.

---

## Null and Alternative Hypotheses

### Definitions

- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: A statement about a population parameter (e.g., the population mean $\mu$).
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)**: The opposite of the null hypothesis.
- Hypothesis testing evaluates whether to reject $H_0$ based on data.

---

## The Null Hypothesis

- Usually represents existing assumptions or no effect.
- Sometimes constructed to challenge what the experimenter believes.
- Example: In sleep research, $H_0$ might assume **no effect** of sleep deprivation.

### Logic of Testing

- **Assume $H_0$ is true**.
- Compute the probability of observing data **as extreme** as the actual outcome.
- If this probability is small, we reject $H_0$.

---

## Critical Region

- The **critical region** is the set of all values that lead to rejecting $H_0$.
- Selected based on significance level and distribution of the test statistic.

---

## Writing the Null Hypothesis

- Denoted: $$H_0$$
- Should:
  - Refer to a population parameter
  - Include a condition of equality (`=`, `≤`, or `≥`)

### Examples

```markdown
H₀: μ = 350 → Population mean is 350  
H₀: π = 70% → Population proportion is 70%  
H₀: μ ≤ 100 → Mean is less than or equal to 100  
H₀: π ≥ 60% → Proportion is at least 60%
```

---

## Dice Example: Null Hypothesis

- Suppose we roll a die 100 times.
- If we assume it's fair, expected result ≈ 350.
- Null hypothesis:  
  $$H_0: \mu = 350$$ (die is fair)

---

## Writing the Alternative Hypothesis

- Denoted: $$H_1$$ or $$H_a$$
- Must:
  - Represent the opposite claim
  - Avoid equality symbols
  - Use `$>`, `$<`, or `$\neq$`

### Examples

```markdown
H₀: μ = 350 → H₁: μ ≠ 350  
H₀: π = 70% → H₁: π ≠ 70%  
H₀: μ ≤ 100 → H₁: μ > 100  
H₀: π ≥ 60% → H₁: π < 60%
```

---

## Determining the Number of Tails

- Based on $H_1$:
  - `$>` or `$<` → One-tailed test
  - `$\neq$` → Two-tailed test

### Rule of Thumb

- Ask: How many alternatives to $H_0$ are presented by $H_1$?

# Significance Level and Hypothesis Testing

## What Is a Significance Level?

- The **significance level**, denoted by $\alpha$, is the threshold used to decide whether to **reject the null hypothesis ($H_0$)**.
- Common choices:  
  - $\alpha = 0.05$ → 5% significance level  
  - $\alpha = 0.01$ → 1% significance level

### Usage in Testing

1. Compute the difference between observed results and the null hypothesis.
2. Assume $H_0$ is true and calculate the probability of observing such a result.
3. Compare this **probability** to the significance level:
   - If $$\text{p-value} \leq \alpha$$ → **Reject $H_0$**  
   - Result is **statistically significant**

---

## Interpreting the Test Decision

Statistical reasoning follows two possible explanations:

1. A very unlikely event occurred.
2. The null hypothesis is false.

The conventional conclusion:  
- The data contradict the null hypothesis strongly enough to **reject $H_0$**, but not to **prove** it's false.

---

## Die Throw Example

- Suppose a die is thrown 100 times and the total sum is **401**.
- Simulations show a fair die yields this result only **1.75%** of the time.
- Under a crooked die scenario, the result is common.
- Conclusion: **Reasonable to suspect the die is biased**, but we cannot prove it definitively.
- Raises the topic of **Type I and II errors** (discussed later).

---

## Properties of Significance Level ($\alpha$)

- It is the **probability of a Type I error**—rejecting $H_0$ when it is true.
- Also described as the probability of the test statistic falling into the **critical region** when $H_0$ is true.
- Lower $\alpha$ → More stringent test → Requires stronger evidence to reject $H_0$

---

## Relationship Between p-Value and Significance

- The **p-value** measures how extreme the observed data are, assuming $H_0$ is true.
- If $$p \leq \alpha$$ → **Reject $H_0$**
- A common misunderstanding:
  - $$p = 0.0175$$ does **not** mean there’s a 1.75% chance $H_0$ is true.
  - It **does** mean: there's a 1.75% chance of observing such extreme data under $H_0$

---

# Hypothesis Testing Procedures

## Procedure 1: Based on p-value

1. **State the null and alternative hypotheses**
2. **Compute test statistic**  
   - E.g., Z or t score
3. **Calculate p-value**
4. **Compare to significance level and decide**
   - $$p \leq \alpha$$ → Reject $H_0$  
   - $$p > \alpha$$ → Do not reject $H_0$

---

## Procedure 2: Based on Critical Value

Designed for written exams; similar structure.

1. **State the null and alternative hypotheses**
2. **Compute test statistic**
3. **Determine critical value**  
   - Based on chosen $\alpha$ and distribution
4. **Decision Rule**  
   - If test statistic is more extreme than critical value → **Reject $H_0**

# Hypothesis Testing: Test Statistics and Critical Values

## What Is a Test Statistic?

- A **test statistic** is a value calculated from sample data.
- It helps determine whether to **reject the null hypothesis ($H_0$)**.
- Its structure varies depending on:
  - The probability model assumed
  - The nature of $H_0$ and $H_1$

### General Formula:

$$
TS = \frac{\text{Observed Value} - \text{Hypothesized Value}}{\text{Standard Error}}
$$

### Example: Dice Experiment

- Observed sum: 401  
- Hypothesized sum under $H_0$: 350  
- Standard error: 17.07  
- Test statistic:  
  $$ TS = \frac{401 - 350}{17.07} \approx 2.99 $$

---

## What Is a Critical Value?

- A **critical value (CV)** is a cutoff value that defines the boundary of the **critical region**.
- It depends on:
  - Chosen significance level $\alpha$ (e.g. 0.05)
  - Whether the test is **one-tailed** or **two-tailed**
  - Sample size and degrees of freedom

### Determination:

- The critical value is computed similarly to quantiles in confidence intervals.
- For small samples, use degrees of freedom $df = n - 1$  
- For large samples, approximate with $df = \infty$

---

## One-Tailed vs. Two-Tailed Tests

### One-Tailed Test

- The rejection region is **entirely in one tail** of the distribution.
- Triggered by $H_1$ of form:  
  - $H_1: \mu > \mu_0$ or $H_1: \mu < \mu_0$

### Two-Tailed Test

- The rejection region is **split between both tails**.
- Triggered by $H_1$ of form:  
  - $H_1: \mu \ne \mu_0$

---

## Critical Region & Decision Rule

- The **critical region (CR)** is where we reject $H_0$.
- The sample space is divided into:
  - Critical region: $$|TS| > CV$$ → Reject $H_0$
  - Non-critical region: $$|TS| \leq CV$$ → Do not reject $H_0$

### Dice Example Decision:

- $$TS = 2.99$$  
- $$CV = 1.96$$ (for $\alpha = 0.05$ two-tailed test)  
- Since $$|2.99| > 1.96$$ → **Reject $H_0$**  
- Interpretation: It's unlikely the die is fair

---

## Four-Step Hypothesis Testing Procedure

1. **State Hypotheses**  
   - Define $H_0$ and $H_1$
2. **Compute Test Statistic**  
   - Standardize observed data using appropriate formula
3. **Determine Critical Value or Compute p-value**  
   - Use significance level and test type
4. **Make Decision**  
   - Reject $H_0$ if test statistic is in critical region or if p-value < $\alpha$
